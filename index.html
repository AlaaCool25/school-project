        <p>The president of India (IAST: Bhārat ke Rāṣṭrapati), officially the president of the Republic of India, is the ceremonial head of state of India and the commander-in-chief of the Indian Armed Forces. Ram Nath Kovind is the 14th and current president.

The office of president was created when India became a republic on 26 January 1950, when its constitution came into force. The president is indirectly elected by an electoral college comprising both houses of the Parliament of India and the legislative assemblies of each of India's states and territories, who themselves are all directly elected.

Although Article 53 of the Constitution of India states that the president can exercise his powers directly or by subordinate authority, with few exceptions, all of the executive powers vested in the president are, in practice, exercised by the prime minister (a subordinate authority) with the help of the Council of Ministers.[3] The president is bound by the constitution to act on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet as long as the advice does not violate the constitution.</p>
